There're two files for each tissue.

1). *.permutations.2rd.txt.gz
columns are:

1. Gene ID. 
2. Number of variants tested in cis for this gene.
3. MLE of the shape1 parameter of the beta distribution.
4. MLE of the shape2 parameter of the beta distribution.
5. Dummy.
6. ID of the best variant found for the gene (with the smallest p-value)
7. Distance between the gene -variant pair.
8. The nominal p-value of association the quantifies how significant from 0, the regression coeeficient is
9. The slope associated with the nominal p-value of association
10. A first permutation p-value directly obtained from the permutations with the direct method. This is basically a corrected version of the nominal p-value that accounts for the fact that multiple variants are tested per gene.
11. A second permutation p-value obtained via beta approximation. Advice to use this one in any downstream analysis.

2) *.nominals.txt.gz

1. Gene ID.
2. ID of the tested variant.
3. Distance between the variant and the gene in bp.
4. The nominal p-value of association.
5. The slope associated with the nominal p-value of association.
